        <h2>Computer Science in OCU</h2>
        <p>After graduating from high school in Spain, at the prestigious Catalan school Joan Ramon Benapres. I received the opportunity to go to college in the USA and I took it. Once in the country I decided to do a major in Computer Science and a minor in Cyber Security, having finished the first year with most of the classes with honors I can say that it has been a great choice and I will continue studying and learning in these three years of college that I have left.</p>

        <h2>I'm Mario Serrano</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Mario Serrano and I'm from Spain. Thanks to a sports scholarship that allows me to choose the major I intend on pursuing in America, I am able to do so. I play goalkeeper for my soccer team, and have done so ever since I can remember plus I've always been a competitive person who hates defeat. But above all, I'm an athlete. My favorite activities right now, as a 19-year-old, are going on vacation with my family and friends and traveling whenever I get the chance. I believe that traveling allows you to encounter other people and their cultures, and I find that fascinating.
        If you want to learn more about me, check out my blog every day or send me any questions in the message box.
